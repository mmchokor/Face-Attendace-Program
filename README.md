## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to create a program that assists University Doctors and teaching assistants with taking student attendance. It will scan students' faces using the camera connected to the device on which the program is running, it will find the face in the video and encode it into data that will be compared with the encoding of the images present in the program database, upon detecting the facial identification, it will save the student's name together with the time he entered the class in a csv file that will be sent to the teacher via Email, after the software is closed by scanning the instructors face.
